# We've moved!

... has been moved to [https://github.com/net-utilities/BigIPReport](https://github.com/net-utilities/BigIPReport)

# Why this was done

## Monetary reasons
So far I've paid for things associated with BigIPReport personally.
But the plan is to use more CI/CD so in order for my company to carry the costs instead I'm moving the project to an organization.

## Organizational reasons
With an organization it'll be easier to group repositories together.
For example separating Docker image manifests from the actual code.
